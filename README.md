# SP-Final-Project
The code and data for SP Final Project

## Data Processing
All the process for data processing is in the "final_project.ipynb"

## Classification
I used Assignment 2 part2 and part5 to provide inspiration. Then "ToothbrushClassification.java" is my first version of this project. I changed "MyWekaUtils.java" and add two more classifier in it.

Based on that I used "feature_selection.java" and "vote.java" as second attemp in simple classifier method.

Finally, I printed the parameters of NeuralNetwork in "ToothbrushClassification.java". I build up my own NN in "NN.java".
