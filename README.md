# SP-Final-Project
The code and data for SP Final Project

## Data
Those csv files under the same folder with name **"combined"** in them are what you need. I realized that this version of github can be too crowded, so this is just our first version. I can upload a clean version in the near future.

## Data Processing
All the process for data processing is in the **"final_project.ipynb"**

## Classification
I used Assignment 2 part2 and part5 to provide inspiration. Then **"ToothbrushClassification.java"** is my first version of this project. I changed **"MyWekaUtils.java"** and add two more classifier in it.

Based on that I used **"feature_selection.java"** and **"vote.java"** as second attemp in simple classifier method.

Finally, I printed the parameters of NeuralNetwork in **"ToothbrushClassification.java"**. I build up my own NN in **"NN.java"**.
